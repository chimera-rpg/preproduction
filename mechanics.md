## Ability Score System
Ability scores should represent have some correspondence to reality but be optimized for gameplay.

We have the following three categories, each of which hold a set of 6 scores each.

  * Physical
  * Spirit
  * Arcane

The six scores that each category holds are:

  * Might -- damage
  * Prowess -- hit points, power points, divine points
  * Focus -- crit %
  * Sense -- detect divine, detect magic
  * Haste -- movement speed, attack speed
  * Reaction -- dodge %

Some species, such as the ghostly ones, would derive their character movement speed from their Spirit Haste stat. Others, such as the golems, would derive their movement speed from their Arcane Haste stat.
